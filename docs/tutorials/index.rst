Hello distributed world
=======================

This tutorial demonstrates a distributed version of the classic *Hello world* example.
Basic usage of the library is described in this demo, just `follow the steps`_.

.. _follow the steps: ../notebooks/hello_distributed_world.ipynb

Automatic network generation
============================

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to generate a network automatically. Access `the network generation notebook`_.

.. _the network generation notebook: ../notebooks/network_generators.ipynb

Creating an animation of a run
==============================

Here we demonstrate how to generate an animation of a simulated algorithm in any given network.
Look at `the animation notebook`_.

.. _the animation notebook: ../notebooks/animation.ipynb

Algorithm benchmarking
======================

This tutorial demonstrates how to benchmark a distributed algorithm. Access `the benchmarking notebook`_.

.. _the benchmarking notebook: ../notebooks/benchmarking.ipynb

Custom algorithm observers
==========================

This tutorial covers how to implement a observable algorithm and its corresponding observer.
Access `the notebook here`_.
