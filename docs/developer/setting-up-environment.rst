Setting up the development environment
======================================


1. Install Python 3.11 (other versions may work, but this is the one I'm using).
2. (optional) Create a virtual environment by running: ``python -m venv venv`` and activate it by running:

    * In Windows: ``venv\Scripts\activate``
    * In Linux: ``source venv/bin/activate``
    * Remember to point your IDE to the python interpreter in the virtual environment.
3. Install the required packages by running:

    * ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
4. Install the required development packages by running:

    * ``pip install -r requirements-dev.txt``
