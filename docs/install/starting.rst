Starting PyDistSim
##################

PyDistSim features interactive console based on IPython. The recommended way of starting this tool is by using
Jupyter notebook or IPython console.

Download the Hello World example from
`here <https://github.com/agustin-recoba/PyDistSim/blob/main/docs/notebooks/hello_distributed_world.ipynb>`_
and run it in your preferred Jupyter notebook environment.

..  note::

    PyDistSim must be installed on the selected Jupyter kernel / IPython environment.

Alternatively, you can run the following command in the terminal::

    $ ipython
    In [1]: from pydistsim import *
    In [2]: ...

And start using PyDistSim in interactive mode. For this, the environment must be already activated.
